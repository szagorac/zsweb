Welcome to the Guidolib project
======================================================================


The Guido project is an open source project that encompasses a music notation format, a score rendering engine and various music score utilities. The Guido Notation Format is a general purpose formal language for representing score-level music in a platform-independent plain text and human readable way. The format comes with various software components for music score rendering and manipulation. The main of these components is the Guido Engine, a library embedable in various platforms and using different programming languages.


## About the Wasm library

The libGUIDOEngine wasm library provides all the services of the Guido Engine. The `guidoengine.js` file is provided as an ES6 interface to the library. The API is similar to the C/C++ API. The `guidoengine.ts` and `libGUIDOEngine.d.ts` files are provided as a typescript class and interface to the library.

See the online [GuidoEditor](https://guidoeditor.grame.fr/) for an example of use.
